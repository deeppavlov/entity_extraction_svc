      "With the MP suspended, the spotlight has turned on what the prime minister knew about allegations against Pincher, who had previously resigned from the whips’ office in 2017 following claims he made unwanted passes at a Tory colleague and acted like a “poundshop Harvey Weinstein”. He was cleared of wrongdoing in a party investigation.\n",

      "Parish was adamant the whip should be withdrawn from his former parliamentary colleague, saying:\n",
      "The first thing they did to me, and I made a huge mistake, is that they withdrew the whip. There cannot be double standards.\n",
      "My belief is that Christopher Pincher has things to be answered for, the whip must be withdrawn and he has the opportunity then to go before the parliamentary standards board to see what his conduct actually was – those that were affected can also give evidence.\n",
      "The former MP expressed disbelief that the party whip had not already been withdrawn.\n",
      "I can’t believe why they haven’t done it, because that was the first thing they did to me, even though I asked for it to be sorted out privately.\n",
      "I just feel it is double standards. But I suspect by this evening or tomorrow the whip will be withdrawn. I can’t believe they can treat us in such different ways.\n",
      "Asked by LBC if he saw himself as badly treated by the Conservatives, he said:\n",
      "I have accepted what happened and I made a big mistake and so up until now, yes I have.\n",
      "But I have to say to you on this occasion, then I am very upset.\n",
      "He suggested that he cut an independent path in parliament, meaning that he had little protection from the party when the scandal broke.\n",
      "The resulting byelection saw the Liberal Democrats take Parish’s former seat, overturning a Conservative majority of more than 24,000.\n",
      "Parish said:\n",
      "I got myself elected to the [Commons environment, food and rural affairs] select committee chair.\n",
      "I never had preferment. I was always keen to hold ministers to account, which is what you do as a select committee chair.\n",
      "And so you weren’t part of the establishment. So when you come to blot your copy book, which I did, I accept that, there was no protection for me and straight over the side of the boat.\n",

      "The referral prompted the chief whip, Chris Heaton-Harris, to suspend the whip from his own former deputy after almost 24 hours of pressure on Johnson to act against Pincher.\n",
      "With the MP suspended, the spotlight has turned on what the prime minister knew about allegations against Pincher, who had previously resigned from the whips’ office in 2017 following claims he made unwanted passes at a Tory colleague and acted like a “poundshop Harvey Weinstein”. He was cleared of wrongdoing in a party investigation.\n",
      "On Friday, the prime minister’s official spokesperson denied he had known about “specific” claims before appointing him as deputy chief whip in February.\n",
      "Chris Pincher, the MP for Tamworth and former Tory deputy chief whip who resigned over groping allegations, has been suspended by the Conservative party amid an ongoing investigation into his alleged misconduct.\n",
      "Downing Street initially appeared to consider the matter closed after Pincher’s resignation.\n",
      "No 10 has denied that Boris Johnson knew about any “specific” sexual misconduct claims against Pincher before promoting in February, while reports emerged that the PM’s chief of staff Steve Barclay had been made aware of concerns about Pincher’s behaviour.\n",
      "Neil Parish, the former Conservative MP for Tiverton and Honiton – who resigned in May after admitting he had watched pornography twice on his phone in parliament – hadaccused the Conservatives of “double standards” prior to Pincher’s suspension and called for “equal treatment” for his former colleague.\n",
      "My colleague Mark Brown has profiled Chris Pincher, who before this week had only been in the national news once: for reportedly having untucked the shirt of the Olympic rower and Tory activist Alex Story, having rubbed his neck, and having told him: “You’ll go far in the Conservative party.”\n",
      "My colleague Libby Brooks, our Scotland correspondent, has written a report on how grassroots groups are preparing for action after a date for a second independence referendum was announced, while the Scottish public remains divided.\n",
      "Former MP who was stripped off whip for watching porn in Commons warns of 'double standards'\n",
      "Neil Parish, the former Conservative MP for Tiverton and Honiton, has said the Conservatives cannot show “double standards” and must remove the whip from the former deputy chief whip Chris Pincher.\n",
      "Parish, who formally resigned in May after admitting he had watched pornography twice on his phone in parliament, suggested that he believed the party whip could be withdrawn from Pincher before the end of Saturday.\n",
      "Parish was adamant the whip should be withdrawn from his former parliamentary colleague, saying:\n",
      "The first thing they did to me, and I made a huge mistake, is that they withdrew the whip. There cannot be double standards.\n",
      "My belief is that Christopher Pincher has things to be answered for, the whip must be withdrawn and he has the opportunity then to go before the parliamentary standards board to see what his conduct actually was – those that were affected can also give evidence.\n",
      "The former MP expressed disbelief that the party whip had not already been withdrawn.\n",
      "I can’t believe why they haven’t done it, because that was the first thing they did to me, even though I asked for it to be sorted out privately.\n",
      "I just feel it is double standards. But I suspect by this evening or tomorrow the whip will be withdrawn. I can’t believe they can treat us in such different ways.\n",
      "Asked by LBC if he saw himself as badly treated by the Conservatives, he said:\n",
      "I have accepted what happened and I made a big mistake and so up until now, yes I have.\n",
      "But I have to say to you on this occasion, then I am very upset.\n",
      "He suggested that he cut an independent path in parliament, meaning that he had little protection from the party when the scandal broke.\n",
      "The resulting byelection saw the Liberal Democrats take Parish’s former seat, overturning a Conservative majority of more than 24,000.\n",
      "Parish said:\n",
      "I got myself elected to the [Commons environment, food and rural affairs] select committee chair.\n",
      "I never had preferment. I was always keen to hold ministers to account, which is what you do as a select committee chair.\n",
      "And so you weren’t part of the establishment. So when you come to blot your copy book, which I did, I accept that, there was no protection for me and straight over the side of the boat.\n",
      "You just think, come on, he may be deputy chief whip, in fact he may have been the man who actually removed the whip from me, so come on, let’s be fair.\n",
      "Post Office collection and cash delivery workers are to stage a one-day strike later this month in a dispute over pay.\n",
      "Members of the Communication Workers Union (CWU) employed in supply chain and admin jobs will walk out on 14 July, PA reports.\n",
      "The workers deliver cash, valuables and essential supplies to thousands of sub-post offices, process finances and work in administration.\n",
      "The dispute is in opposition to a pay offer from the Post Office which the union said was worth 3% for 2022-23, alongside a one-off lump sum payment of 500, and no pay increase for the 2021-22 financial year.\n",
      "The union said the proposals are far beneath the RPI inflation rate of 11.7%.\n",
      "CWU assistant secretary Andy Furey said:\n",
      "The blame for this disruption lies entirely with the senior Post Office leadership, who have repeatedly failed - and wilfully refused - to set out a sensible and fair pay agreement.\n",
      "Everyone knows that the only solution is a fair pay rise that properly rewards members for their extraordinary efforts in serving the public and delivering a profitable Post Office, while also taking account of the extreme cost of living.\n",
      "There most certainly is money available, but management do not want to give workers their fair share.\n",
      "Our message to the employer today is: don’t waste our members’ time by misleading statements.\n",
      "Stop the spin and get serious about pay. Until you do this, the strikes will continue.\n",
      "A Post Office spokesperson said:\n",
      "We have received notice that the CWU has called a strike involving supply chain colleagues.\n",
      "We will have a range of contingency measures in place to minimise any possible disruption to the Post Office network on that day.\n",

      "Last month 3,136 people made the crossing on 76 boats, with journeys taking place on 19 days, according to PA news agency analysis of government figures.\n",
      "Of the 12,690 people who made the journey in the first half of this year, the second highest month for crossings was 3,074 in March.\n",
      "The highest monthly record since 2018 was 6,971 crossings in November 2021.\n",
      "The total for 2022 so far is more than five times the amount recorded between January and June 2020 (2,493) and more than double the six-month tally for the first half of last year (5,917).\n",
      "Crossings continued on Thursday with 94 people arriving in Dover, Kent, in two boats. The figures indicate 51,824 people have made the crossing since 2018.\n",
      "Home Office figures show 28,526 crossed in 2021, compared with 8,466 in 2020, 1,843 in 2019 and 299 in 2018.\n",
      "The number of Channel crossings may be increasing, but represent a fraction of the number of people migrating to Europe.\n",
      "Data from the UN Refugee Agency shows at least 120,441 people arrived in Europe via the Mediterranean by land and sea in 2021.\n",
      "Earlier this week, the home secretary, Priti Patel, struck a fresh deal with Nigeria, which her department said would do more to tackle “illegal migration” and speed up the “removal of foreign criminals”.\n",
      "At the same time, the Home Office said 13 people who had “no right to be in the UK” were deported to Nigeria, with a further eight flown to Ghana.\n"
